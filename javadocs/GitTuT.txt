What is Version control ?
Version control on file-system 
=> Version: Contents of files at one time ,Control: Tracking, storage, and analysis
	- Folders with meaningful names
	- Files with meaningful names
	- Use modification date to see which one was the recent version.
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, 
teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time.
Developers can review project history to find out:

Which changes were made?
Who made the changes?
When were the changes made?
Why were changes needed?

What is Git?
Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
 Git is a Distributed Version Control System. So Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files.
 Instead, every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.
